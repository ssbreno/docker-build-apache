### Explanations

Check usage section and see explanations

 1. You need to install Docker and Docker-Compose, use command `docker-compose build` to build the Dockerfile.
 2. Write `docker-compose up -d` to setup the container.
 3. After that u can acess the url `0.0.0.0:8082/hello/Test` to test and go study.

```
 CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
fa55b47b76e1        docker-build-slimphp   "php -S 0.0.0.0:8082â€¦"   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        0.0.0.0:8082->8082/tcp   docker-build-slimphp
```

### Test

1. Go in 0.0.0.0:8082 and test the example route in `routes.php` 0.0.0.0:8082/hello/Test
2. To test the database connection you need to build in Dockerfile a MySQL or Postgresql and acess that.
3. Afterthat you setup that in `routes.php` to acess the route.
